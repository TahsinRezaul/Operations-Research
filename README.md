# Operations-Research
Operation research was conducted for ATS University using MATLAB and CPLEX. There were three problems that were analyzed.

	Problem definition 1: Integer Programming 
ATS University would like to welcome its new law students to campus by hosting a fundraiser. Due to the size of the fundraiser, the university decides to host the event at a law firm. The law firm has many different rooms to rent out to ATS University. The prices vary for each room due to the room capacity. The University is expecting 2000 guests to attend the event and would like to know which options will allow them to meet all necessary requirements while also minimizing the overall cost. ATS university is using all proceedings from the fundraiser towards providing the new law school students with adequate resources during their academic years.

	Problem definition 2: Dynamic Programming 
ATS University is looking at buying new printers because the current printers are becoming outdated. Before purchasing new printers, the university would like to conduct market research to ensure that the new printers will last a long time while also being cost-effective. For this problem, dynamic programming is used to determine if after each year they should sell or keep the printer. The goal is to optimize the profit by determining the frequency at which they should be changing the printers. This resource-allocation problem determines the best time for equipment replacement. There is a fixed amount of resources that were considered when determining operating costs, and revenue to solve the problem. 

	Problem definition 3: Stochastic Process
Universities constantly do surveys and analyze data in order to improve classes and have a higher success rate. In this case, ATS university wants to analyze the success rate in engineering math courses and make sure they are not too demanding compared to other universities. Data were collected regarding the success and failure rates of students for each math course at ATS University. Markov chain is used to analyze this data and provide insight regarding student performance. This study shows the general census of students' success/failure in the math courses of engineering as they progress through university over time.
